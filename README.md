# Read Excel files in Java using Apache POI

The purpose of this application is to read Excel files using open source library Apache POI and import all of the record from excel file to the database. Instead of adding all the record one by one from excel file to database, we can directly use the implemented REST call, which will import all the records at once, hence saves time and effort.
